* Fix the blemish of requiring lemon::test<>, and instead make it just lemon::test if possible.
* Add support for indenting sub-tests, so that we could have:

1..2
ok 1 - Make sure of something
  1..3
  ok 1 - Subtest part 1 passes
  ok 2 - Subtest part 2 passes
  ok 3 - Subtest part 3 passes
  # Looks like you passed all 3 tests.
ok 2 - Subtests pass
# Looks like you passed all 2 tests.
