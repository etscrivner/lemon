~ lemon ~

lemon is a small, fast unit-testing framework designed to take almost no time
to set up.
   
~ Philosophy ~

lemon is designed to be small, really small. That way you can worry less
about setting up the framework and more about writing tests.

~ Installation ~

Just add lemon.h to your project or place it in a common directory for your
compiler (On Linux/Mac/Unix this might be /usr/local/include).

~ Getting Started ~

To start writing tests in lemon:

  1) Initialize lemon

  Lemon lemon(num_tests_which_will_be_run);

  2) Conduct tests

  lemon.is(this_one_equal_to, that_one, descriptive_test_name);

  3) Display results

  lemon.end();

~ Assertions ~

lemon provides a minimal set of assertions:

  * ok(boolean_condition, descriptive_test_name)

  * not_ok(boolean_condition, descriptive_test_name)

  * is(this_one, that_one, descriptive_test_name)

  * isnt(this_one, that_one, descriptive_test_name)

  * pass(descriptive_test_name)

  * fail(descriptive_test_name)

  * skip(reason, num_to_skip)

  * todo(what)
