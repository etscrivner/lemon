Lemon - A simple, lightweight unit-testing framework.

Philosophy
============
Lemon is designed to be easy to get up and running so you can worry more
about writing unit tests and less about finding an agreeable framework.
If lemon doesn't have something you need feel free to add it. If you
think other people might like it then by all means share it.

Installation
=============
Installation of lemon is easy:

Just add lemon.h to your project or place it in a common directory. For Unix,
Linux or Mac users this might be some place like /usr/include or
/usr/local/include.

Once that's done just include lemon.h and start testing!
